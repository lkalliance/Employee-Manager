# Employee Manager [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This CLI application allows a user to enter information about a company's organization and to display it in an organized fashion based on an information tree of Department > Role > Employee.

I like keeping track of the staff of my local MLB franchise, I don't think they get enough attention. It occurred to me that actual business owners might make good use of such a tool as well! So I made this.

## Installation Instructions

This is a Node.js application that usitilizes a MySQL database. Make sure you have MySQL installed on the host computer. 

There are several several dependency modules, all either available via npm or custom built and included. The custom modules are in the /modules directory, and the dependencies can be installed with "npm i" in the presence of this app's "package.json" file. In its abssence, download these npm modules:
* inquirer (no later than version 8.2.4)
* mysql2
* press-any-key
* console.table

Once all the modules are in place, run the provided schema sql file (/db/schema.sql) at your mysql prompt to create the database. You can also pre-seed the database with some test data by running the seeds file (/db/seeds.sql).


## Usage Information

To launch the Employee Manger, in your terminal from inside the diretory where you've installed the application run "npm start", or in the absence of npm run "node index".

You will be offered a series of available actions:
* View Employees, Roles or Departments
* Add Employee, Role or Department
* Update an employee's Role or Manager

The definitions of each kind of entity are cascading: Roles are children of Departments, so to enter a Role you must have at least one Department; Employees must have a Role, so to enter an Employee you must have at least one Role.

To enter a Department, Role or Employee, simply follow the prompts after selecting the action. An employee's Role and Manager can be updated later. You do have the option of listing Employee with no Manager, but not with no Role. To update an employee's Role or Manager, select the action and follow the prompts.

In all, the data associated with each entity are:
* Departments have an (auto-entered) id, and a name.
* Roles have an (auto-entered) id, a title, a salary, and belong to a Department.
* Employees hava an (auto-entered) id, a first and last name, inhabit a Role, and report to a Manager. Via their assigned Role, they have a related Department and salary.

Viewing any of the lists is simple: select the appropriate option. Departments are sorted by id, Roles are sorted by Department and then by salary, and Employees are sorted by last name.


## Application Features

* Simple, directed entry interface
* Relational assignment of Departments and salaries to employees
* Guardrails to prevent illogical associations
* A snazzy splash screen!


## Credits

The original code for the Employee Manager is written by Lee Klusky. Per usual, I have received guidance and the contribution of much wisdom from the instructional and tutorial staff of the University of Minnesota Full Stack Coding Boot Camp. I've also received much wisdom from developers and commenters from around the Web, most notably at [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com), the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org), and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com).
